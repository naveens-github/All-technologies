# Characteristics of an agile mindset:   
#### Put customers first   
      With an Agile mindset, people value creativity and look for opportunities to experiment and innovate. 
      Team members with this mindset encourage the people around them to do the same. Engaging in experimentation means taking risks, 
      which can lead to unique solutions and valuable outcomes.   
#### Trust in the team   
      Rather than preferring to work within siloed departments and processes, team members with an Agile mindset value autonomy and are 
      comfortable working in a self-managed team. They can work independently and get their work done with little direct supervision.

# Agile Principles   
      1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
      2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive 
      advantage.
      3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter 
      timescale.
      4. Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
      5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the
      job done.
      6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face
      conversation.
      7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
      8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant
      pace indefinitely.
      9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
      10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
      11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
      12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
