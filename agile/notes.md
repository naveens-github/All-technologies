# Characteristics of an agile mindset:   
#### Put customers first   
      With an Agile mindset, people value creativity and look for opportunities to experiment and innovate. 
      Team members with this mindset encourage the people around them to do the same. Engaging in experimentation means taking risks, 
      which can lead to unique solutions and valuable outcomes.   
#### Trust in the team   
      Rather than preferring to work within siloed departments and processes, team members with an Agile mindset value autonomy and are 
      comfortable working in a self-managed team. They can work independently and get their work done with little direct supervision.

# Agile Principles   
      1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
      2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive 
      advantage.
      3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter 
      timescale.
      4. Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
      5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the
      job done.
      6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face
      conversation.
      7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
      8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant
      pace indefinitely.
      9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
      10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
      11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
      12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# Scrum
      * Scrum is a framework that unites business and development. It focuses on teams delivering products of the highest value while 
        also being productive and efficient.  
        
      * On a Scrum team, there are generally two sides of a project: business and development. The business side of the project is 
        typically represented by a Product Owner (PO), who is accountable for maximizing the product's value resulting from the Scrum 
        team’s work. The PO communicates with key stakeholders and is responsible for the product backlog. The development side is 
        represented by the whole development team, with the Scrum Master facilitating Scrum practices and helping the development team 
        monitor and improve their workflow.    
        
   **Daily Scrums:** brief check-ins that occur each day—enable team members to assess how successfully they are moving toward the 
                     Sprint goal.   
   **Sprint Planning:** an event when all team members initiate the Sprint by laying out the work to perform.          
   **Sprint Review:** a timeboxed working session when the team and key stakeholders review the outcomes of a Sprint and identify 
                      future steps.   
   **Sprint Retrospective:** an event when team members discuss what went well, what could be improved, and commit to improvements 
            in the next Sprint....
      
# Best Practices for Agile
      1. Create and maintain a product backlog that is used as a single source for your tasks.
      2. Update and prioritize a backlog regularly with the team.
      3. Create a business roadmap aligned with the product backlog.
      4. Have regular sprint reviews.
      5. A Product Owner provides detailed positive or negative feedback on regular sprint reviews.
      6. Reprioritize a backlog based on the feedback from PO and stakeholders during regular demo/review sessions.
      7. Involve the whole team in the decision negotiations.
